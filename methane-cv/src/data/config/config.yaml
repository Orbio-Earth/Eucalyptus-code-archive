# The defaults section is where we point to the config snippets to compose into
# this main config. For example, satellite can be any one snippets in `config/satellite/`
# and if the user sets `satellite=s2` in the CLI, then the contents of `config.satellite/s2.yaml`
# are added to this config under the `satellite` key.
defaults:
  - _self_

  # Which satellite to use (s2, emit, etc.). '???' means no default value.
